Hey there! Welcome to Everviolet, the home of the [Evergarden colorscheme][evergarden] and all the cool things that come with it. :seedling:

Everviolet is all about keeping Evergarden alive and spreading its cozy vibes across different apps, editors, and tools. We’re here to make sure you get a beautiful, consistent experience everywhere. ✨

Evergarden is a colorscheme inspired by lush forests, enchanted groves, and the calm of nature.
It’s designed to be easy on the eyes, elegant, and just plain nice to look at—whether you’re coding, writing, or just staring at your terminal for fun (we won’t judge).
